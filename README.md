# The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann: My Progress and Enhancements

## Introduction

This repo is dedicated to my progress in the Udemy course, "The Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann. The course is a comprehensive guide to JavaScript, covering everything from fundamentals to advanced topics like async programming, ES6+ features, and best practices. I am using this as a guide to build up my JavaScript skills and strengthen my existing knowledge.

## Why This Repo?

I'm creating this repository for several reasons:

1. **Accountability:** By updating this repo regularly, I hold myself accountable for consistent learning and progress.
2. **Reference:** This serves as a quick reference for the future when I need to revisit certain topics.
3. **Showcase:** It allows me to showcase my skills and the depth of my understanding of JavaScript.

## Beyond the Course

While the course itself provides an excellent foundation, I believe in the value of practice and exploration to reinforce learning. Therefore, you'll also find:

- Improved versions of the projects and exercises in the course, where I've used my existing knowledge to optimize the code.
- Extra comments and documentation to clarify complex JavaScript functionalities and features.

## Scripts

This repository includes a script named copy-starter-files.sh, located in the scripts directory. The script automates the process of copying the initial 'starter files' from the cloned complete-javascript-course repository into their corresponding folders within this repository.

By running this script, I can populate the folders here with the original starter files from the course, while keeping my own work separate. This approach lets me follow along with the course, utilizing the initial files provided, without modifying / using the cloned course repository.
