# The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann: My Progress and Enhancements

## Introduction

This repo is dedicated to my progress in the Udemy course, ["The Complete JavaScript Course"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann. The course is a comprehensive guide to JavaScript, covering everything from fundamentals to advanced topics like async programming, ES6+ features, and best practices. I am using this as a guide to build up my JavaScript skills and strengthen my existing knowledge.

## Why This Repo?

I'm creating this repository for several reasons:

1. **Accountability:** By updating this repo regularly, I hold myself accountable for consistent learning and progress.
2. **Reference:** This serves as a quick reference for the future when I need to revisit certain topics.
3. **Showcase:** It allows me to showcase my skills and the depth of my understanding of JavaScript.

## My Approach

My learning approach for this course is hands-on and focused on self-assessment. For challenges and projects, I first pause the video to try writing my own solutions. After that, I resume the course to compare my work with Jonas' techniques. This strategy allows me to test my current understanding, see alternative methods, and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, I will be incorporating custom code into projects when I see fit or think it could enhance the project. This not only deepens my understanding but also allows me to explore creative solutions. It's a balanced way to both apply what I've learned and benefit from expert insights.

## Commit Message Tags

In this repository, I use specific tags in my git commit messages to quickly convey the type of changes made. Here are the tags and what they represent:

- **update:** Used when updating the progress of a particular topic or section.
  - _Example: `update: 02 - complete arrays`_

- **complete:** Indicates the completion of a section or challenge within the course.
  - _Example: `complete: 05 - section complete`_

- **refactor**: Reserved for smaller, more focused changes aimed at restructuring the code without altering its functionality. This includes changes for code readability or minor performance optimization.
  - _Example: `refactor: 07 - simplified conditional logic in 'x' function`_

- **improve**: Used when making substantial changes to existing files. This can involve optimizing the code, implementing better solutions, or even re-writing sections for better performance.
  - _Example: `improve: 08 - overhauled logic and variables in script`_
  - **Note**: It isn't always easy to distinguish between refactor and improve. In general, I use refactor for smaller, more focused changes and improve for larger, more substantial changes.

- **custom:** Denotes commits where I have added custom code or features that I thought were valuable additions to the project.
  - _Example: `custom: 09 - added additional data structure`_

- **style:** Commits focused solely on stylistic changes like formatting, indentation, or aesthetic updates.
  - _Example: `style: 10 - added disabled style for buttons`_

- **fix:** Used when a bug is identified and corrected.
  - _Example: `fix: 11 - resolved issue with incorrect function call`_

- **docs:** Indicates commits that are primarily focused on updating documentation, comments, or the README.
  - _Example: `docs: updated readme`_

## Beyond the Course

While the course itself provides an excellent foundation, I believe in the value of practice and exploration to reinforce learning. Therefore, you'll also find:

- Improved versions of the projects and exercises in the course, where I've used my existing knowledge to optimize the code.
- Extra comments and documentation to clarify complex JavaScript functionalities and features.

## [Scripts](scripts)

This repository includes a script named copy-starter-files.sh, located in the scripts directory. The script automates the process of copying the initial 'starter files' from the cloned complete-javascript-course repository into their corresponding folders within this repository.

By running this script, I can populate the folders here with the original starter files from the course, while keeping my own work separate. This approach lets me follow along with the course, utilizing the initial files provided, without modifying / using the cloned course repository.
